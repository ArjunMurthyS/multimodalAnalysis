# multimodalAnalysis

## General
This code contains sample code for the Course "Multimoda Information Processing and Analysis"
of the MSc in Data Science, of the National Centre for Scientific Research "Demokritos".

The course covers introductory issues with regards to audio segmentation and classification,
 image processing, image feature extraction, segmentation and classification, video analysis and multimodal fusion.


## Dependencies
All code has been tested in Python3, but in most of the cases it is also compatible in Python2.7.
Dependencies can be installed using pip and the requirements.txt files in each folder (e.g. audio/requirements.txt).
